[h2]Starting the Gamemode[/h2]
Define the gamemode when starting the game/server:

[h2]Bugsplats/Crashes[/h2]
In case you experience bugsplats/crashes [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/2050370803/2259060348501938096/]this fix from Controlled Difficulty - Blackout Edition[/url] seems to help many gamemodes and mutators as well as this.
[quote=H U N ナ E R]The problem is caused by TWI changing several values in the KF2's engine configuration.
Find these lines in Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Config\KFEngine.ini file:
MaxObjectsNotConsideredByGC=33476
SizeOfPermanentObjectPool=0

If you have other numeric values, make them as written above and save. After changes bugsplats in more cases should disappear.[/quote]

This mod seems to be incompatibel with KF-Elysium.
